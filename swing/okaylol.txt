operating system is our mediator for english lang to binary

os- software

software- it is a program.
program- program is a set of instructuons arranged un order to perform a particular task

2 types of software
1. System software 
	1.Operating system
		i)window ii)unix-linux iii)ms- dos(disk operating system(
		iv)mac-dos v) mac-windows
	2.Device drivers: mostly uses c or c++
	theyre also software programs, which helps you communicate with the specific devices(hardware etc) 

 2. Application software
	i)MS word
	ii)wordpad
	iii)excel, powerpoint, tally, yt


Devices:
3 types of devices:
1. Input devices
	ex:keybaord, mouse, gamepad etc
2. Output
	ex:monitor, speakers, printer etc

 3. Storage device
	1. Primary memory/temporary memory
		i)RAM(Random access memory)
		ii)ROM(Read only memory)
	2. Secondary memory/ permanent memory
		i)Harddisks
		ii)cds
		iii)pen drives


Languages
3 levels of languages:
A language(programming language) is used to develop a software.
ex: java,c,c++, python, ruby etc;

1. high lvl language:
it is fully written in english/human understandable language
ex: python, java 

2. low level language:
 it is written in assembly language


3. middle level language:
c is middle lvl language.

because disk drivers are written in assembly language and the normal programming uses eng/human understandable language.

Linker= links the object files and library files together

.exe file= executable files. these are also stored in harddisk- is 10k times slower than cpu

4. LoaderOS- loads the exe file into RAM

5.RAM- 4 parts/segments
	1. data
	2.stack
	3.heap
	4.code
6.CPU- will give us the output



IDE- Integrated Development environment
vs code, turboc

turbo c: tc.exe ide's
compiler: tcc.exe
linker-Tlink.exe
library files-.lib, .h

Structure of C:
