Networking: Communication between one or more systems over the network.

Server: is a software, which takes request and gives response.

	types of servers:
		1. Operating system servers: helps you to operate systems over the network.
			1.1 unix
			1.2 Linux
			1.3 windows-nt
			1.4 windows-2000
			1.5 windows 2014

		2. Database Servers: used to store data in the form of rows and columns over the network.
			2.1 DB2(IBM).
			2.2 Oracle(oracle).
			2.3 Ms-sql(Microsoft)
			2.4 MySQL(oracle)

		3. Webservers: are used to access webpages over the network.
			Tomcat
			weblogic	
			webspeher
			glassfish
			MS IIs(internet information service)
		4. com/dcom: component object model, distributed component object model.

	Client: is a software, which requests and takes response.


	IP Adress: a unique id which helps you to identify a system over the network. (internet protocol address).

	Protocol: is a software which has a set of rules, to tranfer the data over the network.
		
		1.tcp/ip(transmission control protocol and internet protocol)
		2.http
		3.https (hypertext transfer protocol and secured socket layer).
		4.ftp (file transfer protocol)
		5.udp (user datagram protocol) post man/post letter
		6.smtp (simple message transfer).

	portno: is used to identify a (server/client) software in a system, we need a portno.

		0 to 1000 ports are used by wellknown servers
		0 to 65535(logical)

	socket porgramming.
	
	server will be waiting in a system on a particular port.

	client will make a request to the server program by using an ip address and a port no.

	once the server recieves the request, server will accept the client and creates a socket object which contains client information(ipaddress, port no, protocol).

	once the server recieves and creates a socket object, server will also give response to the client software, now client also creates a socket object which contains server information.
