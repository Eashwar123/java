Difference between private classes and protected classes
Private:
A private member is only accessible by the class in which it is declared. Other classes, even subclasses, cannot directly access or modify it.
Protected:
A protected member is accessible within the class where it is declared, within its subclasses (regardless of their package), and sometimes within the same package as the class.
